## Introduction

This Shiny dashboard is a tool for exploring the quantification of COVID-19 at a state level. Select variables to highlight countries and compare in-group and overall means.

Remember that visualizations like this can often tell us more about a region's testing capacity and reporting infrastructure than about the number of infections or deaths actually present at any given time.

Questions, suggestions, or requests for additional stats or functionalities to be added to the app can be directed to contactmspringsteen@gmail.com

The app is updated daily to reflect changes to the underlying data.

## Data

COVID-19 metrics are drawn from the [Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData). Testing data is from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/). Data detailing policy actions taken is from the [CoronaNet Project](https://coronanet-project.org/index.html). Statistics describing the 50 states, plus Puerto Rico, were compiled from the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219). Data for Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the US Virgin Islands is from:
- the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.worldbank.org/): for population, percent of population aged 65+, and poverty data
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page): for population density data
